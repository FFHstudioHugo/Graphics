# View and control a light from its perspective

The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) includes the light placement tool which you can use to view a scene from a light source’s perspective. You can use this tool to move and modify any type of light source.

This tool does not affect any cameras in your scene. The scene view camera returns to its original position when you disable the light placement tool.

4. Use the camera controls (pan, orbit, zoom) to adjust the light’s position.
5. Use the light’s gizmos to adjust its properties.

To exit the light placement tool use one of the following methods: 
* Press "**Escape**".
* Select the light placement tool icon.
* Select another GameObject.

The scene view camera automatically returns to its previous position.
